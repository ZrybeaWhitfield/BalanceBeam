# BalanceBeam

## Overview

BalanceBeam is a personal debt payoff planner designed to turn real-life cashflow into a practical payment strategy.

Instead of just tracking balances, BalanceBeam generates a biweekly action plan based on debt terms, interest rates, and available income. The goal is to reduce monthly obligations while minimizing long-term interest.
